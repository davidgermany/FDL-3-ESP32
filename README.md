Iam in the process of reviving this project, so that you can build it from off the shelf components.

My goals for the required Hardware:

off the shelf components available everywhere in the world:




ESP32 Microcontroller

Nokia Display with already soldered on Pins (alternatively basic OLED screen)

In the future I will upload the .stl files as well as the needed ESP32 firmware available here on github, don't worry it is on my todo list.

I want this Blaster to be:

-Cheap parts you can always buy as they are "general purpose" built and mass produced.

-NO CUSTOM PCB's.

-NO CUSTOM SCREEN.

-Assembly should be as easy as possible, simply 3D printing all the parts, connecting all the electronics and then assembling everything with a couple M3 screws.

-Easy to read, understand and change firmware for your specific purpose (although the parts I found for this project are recommended, and will hopefully be available for a long time, one day there will be something better, so I will not stand in your way to change it.)

-Enough space inside to fit all the electronics nicely, enough space for long cables so you can easily access all the parts.

I'm currently in the making of this project, I know it is possible and is worth doing, as the Project-FDL company is not producing any more FDL-3 blasters

Current state of the Project:
.stl files: being tested (9/10 finished) they are probably finished already, but I will have to print them and build it first to confirm that everything fits.
Make sure your 3D printer is dimensionally accurate, I have multiple 3D printers so I will make sure the parts are not just based on my printer but is generally usable as long as your printer is set up correctly, this process is not very easy and.
ESP32 firmware: being developed (1/10 finished) in the process of figuring out how to drive brushless DC motors with ESP32
